# Knowledge Release (knowledge-release.yaml)

`.github/workflows/knowledge-release.yaml` runs on a published release once `KNOWLEDGE_RELEASE_ENABLED` is `true`, and when dispatched. Its `pack` job reads the checkout, validates the bundle and packs it, and says whether the bundle or the schema changed since the last release. Its `attach` job then attaches the assets, each with its `.sha256` and a build-provenance attestation.[^knowledge-release.yaml]
