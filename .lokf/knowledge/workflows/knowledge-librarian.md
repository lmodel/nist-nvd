# Knowledge Librarian (knowledge-librarian.yaml)

`.github/workflows/knowledge-librarian.yaml` runs the ktl-librarian skill every Monday at 05:00 UTC and by hand, once `KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARIAN_ENABLED` is `true`. Its `earlier` job reads what became of the earlier pull requests. Its `refresh` job runs the agent with no write token, from the skills pinned at `TRUST_LADDER_SKILLS_REF` v0.61.0. Its `publish` job runs no agent and opens the review pull request, refusing a change outside the bundle or to a person's record.[^knowledge-librarian.yaml]
