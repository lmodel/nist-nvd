# Knowledge website (knowledge-website.yaml)

`.github/workflows/knowledge-website.yaml` builds the site in `website/` on a pull request or push that touches its inputs, on Mondays at 05:23 UTC and by hand. Its `build` job reads the checkout only. Its `deploy` job alone holds `pages: write` and `id-token: write`, and deploys from `main` once `KNOWLEDGE_WEBSITE_ENABLED` is `true`.[^knowledge-website.yaml]
