# Semantic release (semantic-release.yml)

`.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml` has two jobs. On a pull request to `main`, `plan` reads the checkout and says what the merge would release. On a push to `main`, `release` runs in the `release` Environment. It installs its tools from `.github/release/package-lock.json` with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. It then promotes the changelog, tags the release, publishes it, and dispatches the knowledge release once `KNOWLEDGE_RELEASE_ENABLED` is `true`.[^semantic-release.yml]
