# Knowledge Registrar (knowledge-registrar.yaml)

`.github/workflows/knowledge-registrar.yaml` is the gate of the Knowledge Trust Ladder (KTL) sidecar. It runs on a pull request that touches `.lokf/` or `knowledge_bundle`, on Mondays at 06:00 UTC and by hand. Its `validate` job runs `lokf validate --check-refs` and the conventions script. Its `provenance` job checks that each new `human:` confirmation is backed by the pull request's approval or a signed commit.[^knowledge-registrar.yaml]
