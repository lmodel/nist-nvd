# Knowledge sync (knowledge-sync.yaml)

`.github/workflows/knowledge-sync.yaml` runs every Monday at 04:10 UTC and by hand. It reads the skills pin and KTL's newest release, and when the pin is behind it copies the files `knowledge-sync.manifest` lists from that release. Its `publish` job opens or refreshes one pull request. A change to a workflow waits for the review Environment that `KNOWLEDGE_SYNC_REVIEW_ENVIRONMENT` names.[^knowledge-sync.yaml]
